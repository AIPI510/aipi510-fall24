# Module 1: Basics of Z-Scores and Normal Distributions

# This module introduces the fundamental concepts of Z-scores and normal distributions. 
# It covers the following key topics:

# 1. **Z-Scores**:
#    - A Z-score measures how many standard deviations a given data point is from the mean.
#    - The Z-score formula is presented, and its components (X, mean, and standard deviation) are explained.
   
# 2. **Normal Distribution**:
#    - Explains the properties of a normal distribution, including symmetry, the alignment of mean, median, and mode, 
#      and how the standard deviation determines the spread of the data.
#    - Visualizes the standard normal distribution with a bell curve, highlighting key points like the mean and ¬±1 standard deviation.
   
# 3. **Interactive Visualization**:
#    - A static visualization is generated using Plotly to show the standard normal distribution curve. 
#    - Key statistical markers such as the mean and ¬±1 standard deviation are also indicated on the plot.

# This module is designed to provide users with an intuitive understanding of Z-scores and the normal distribution, 
# preparing them for more advanced topics in subsequent modules.

# Progress is tracked using `st.session_state` to ensure users' progress through the modules is saved.

# This module allows users to interactively explore how changing the mean (Œº) and standard deviation (œÉ) affects 
# the shape and position of a normal distribution. The module features:

# 1. **Interactive Controls**:
#    - Users can adjust the **mean** and **standard deviation** of the normal distribution using sliders in the sidebar.
#    - The changes are reflected in real-time on an interactive Plotly graph, allowing users to see the immediate effect of these parameters.

# 2. **Normal Distribution Plot**:
#    - A normal distribution is plotted based on the user-selected values of Œº and œÉ.
#    - The x-axis is fixed to range from -20 to 20, and the y-axis is fixed to a common probability density range (0 to 0.5) to keep the visual scale consistent.
#    - The plot is updated dynamically as the user adjusts the mean and standard deviation.

# 3. **Detailed Explanation**:
#    - Provides insights into how the **mean (Œº)** shifts the center of the distribution along the x-axis while keeping the shape of the distribution unchanged.
#    - Explains the role of **standard deviation (œÉ)** in controlling the spread of the distribution:
#      - A smaller œÉ results in a narrow, tall peak (data clustered near the mean).
#      - A larger œÉ results in a wider, flatter curve (data more spread out).
#    - Discusses key statistical properties such as the **Empirical Rule** (68-95-99.7 rule) and how much data lies within 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations from the mean.

# 4. **Real-World Interpretation**:
#    - Offers practical examples, showing how variations in œÉ indicate the degree of spread or variability in datasets like exam scores, stock prices, or patient outcomes.

    ### Detailed Insights:

    #### Mean (Œº):
    - The **mean (Œº)** represents the center of the distribution. 
    - As the **mean** shifts, the peak of the distribution moves **left or right** along the x-axis, but the shape of the distribution remains the same.
    - For example, with **Œº = {mean:.2f}**, the distribution is centered at **{mean:.2f}**.
    - The mean is also the **balance point** of the distribution, which means that half of the data lies to the left of this value, and half lies to the right.
    
    #### Standard Deviation (œÉ):
    - The **standard deviation (œÉ)** controls the **spread** or **width** of the distribution.
    - A **smaller œÉ** results in a **narrow, tall** curve, meaning the data is more tightly clustered around the mean. 
    - A **larger œÉ** produces a **wider, flatter** curve, indicating that the data is more spread out from the mean.
    - With **œÉ = {std_dev:.2f}**, the curve shows that approximately:
        - **68%** of the data lies within **1œÉ** of the mean (from {mean - std_dev:.2f} to {mean + std_dev:.2f}).
        - **95%** of the data lies within **2œÉ** of the mean (from {mean - 2 * std_dev:.2f} to {mean + 2 * std_dev:.2f}).
        - **99.7%** of the data lies within **3œÉ** of the mean (from {mean - 3 * std_dev:.2f} to {mean + 3 * std_dev:.2f}).
    - This is known as the **Empirical Rule**, and it highlights how data is distributed across the curve.

    #### Shape of the Curve:
    - **Symmetry**: The normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, meaning that the left and right sides of the curve are mirror images.
    - The height of the peak represents the **probability density** at the mean.
    - As you change **œÉ**, the height and width of the curve adjust. A smaller standard deviation results in a **taller** and **narrower** peak, indicating that most of the data is concentrated around the mean.
    - As **œÉ** increases, the curve becomes **flatter**, indicating that data is more spread out, with higher variability.

    #### Real-World Interpretations:
    - If the standard deviation is small, it suggests that data points (e.g., exam scores, stock prices, or patient outcomes) are consistently close to the mean.
    - If the standard deviation is large, it indicates greater variation or uncertainty in the data, meaning values are more spread out from the average.
