"Finally left my company, is this normal? ","So if you look at my post history I’ve been at this internship for like a year now and the whole time it’s been a shit show. I had nothing to do for 6 months, then once I graduated they were throwing me in the deep end and ultimately I got stuck with a miserable team lead who was trying to make my life miserable as well.

It all just feels so weird. All of a sudden in the weeks leading up to me leaving everyone is talking to me and I’m getting so much insight. I thought I was the only one who would get berated, yelled at, talked down to condescendingly, teased, and just overall treated bad.

I guess all the interns went through this guy and there whole thing is that I guess he “breaks in the interns,” and he’s really just a rude guy and I had an incident where he put his hand on my shoulder trying to make me count down the clock and that’s when i rescinded my offer.

I just had an exit interview and I wanted to keep it as brief as possible, so I just said I had a conflict with him and kept it vague in case I wanted to comeback to this company. The director guy who was interviewing me was astonished that I’ve been here for over a year, asking where they even got the funding for that, he was astonished that they didn’t teach me more, and I guess my department didn’t follow like the normal internship protocols.

I just feel very weird bc once everyone started saying they experienced the same thing I feel like maybe I’m being a wimp but also at the same time maybe I’m the only one who stood up for myself.

I guess some of the younger engineers had it worse than me and they were telling me how this guy would tell them in their face about how disqualified they were for the job and that why did they even get hired (which would crush me). 

Like idk if this is normal at all companies, it just felt like the entire time everything has been so disorganized, nobody really knows what’s going on, but everyone just tries to keep going to get a paycheck.

I feel weird about it also bc I don’t have anything lined up and even though I’m waiting to hear back from 2 companies on interviews, I do know that the job market is tough. I just hated the stress of not knowing what was asked of me and being belittled for it, and I was so afraid to make mistakes or talk to anyone that I just sort of knew that I couldn’t live like that.

I just feel so confused tbh and the director guy was so astonished and said that I could always comeback, my supervisor told me that as well, so idk it all feels very odd. I kind of just wanted more meaningful work bc it was DOD contracter work and it’s all very system engineering focused which doesn’t have that much engineering. ","Hello /u/MurkyNeedleworker193!

,," Is not normal, the guy is an asshole and just because others thought it was okay to suck it up doesn’t mean what he’s doing is okay. I’m glad you stood up for yourself, never let anyone treat you like shit in the workplace, no matter their position."
,,"Horribly toxic and abusive work environment, just because other people suffered through it does NOT make it okay. It is not the norm and should not be treated as such.  I'm glad you got out. Do not go back to this company ever, it's too bad you already did your interview because I would have said to take and bring notes, and rail the guy leading this whole shit show, he deserves to be fired."
,,I know a lot of companies blow off the intern until they're about to leave then cram everything down their throat. It's not good practice by any means but definitely happens. The other stuff is definitely not normal
,,This sounds like the average DOD civilian. Does he go around talking about how he was a retired SGM?
