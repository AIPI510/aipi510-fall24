"Finally left my company, is this normal? ","So if you look at my post history I‚Äôve been at this internship for like a year now and the whole time it‚Äôs been a shit show. I had nothing to do for 6 months, then once I graduated they were throwing me in the deep end and ultimately I got stuck with a miserable team lead who was trying to make my life miserable as well.

It all just feels so weird. All of a sudden in the weeks leading up to me leaving everyone is talking to me and I‚Äôm getting so much insight. I thought I was the only one who would get berated, yelled at, talked down to condescendingly, teased, and just overall treated bad.

I guess all the interns went through this guy and there whole thing is that I guess he ‚Äúbreaks in the interns,‚Äù and he‚Äôs really just a rude guy and I had an incident where he put his hand on my shoulder trying to make me count down the clock and that‚Äôs when i rescinded my offer.

I just had an exit interview and I wanted to keep it as brief as possible, so I just said I had a conflict with him and kept it vague in case I wanted to comeback to this company. The director guy who was interviewing me was astonished that I‚Äôve been here for over a year, asking where they even got the funding for that, he was astonished that they didn‚Äôt teach me more, and I guess my department didn‚Äôt follow like the normal internship protocols.

I just feel very weird bc once everyone started saying they experienced the same thing I feel like maybe I‚Äôm being a wimp but also at the same time maybe I‚Äôm the only one who stood up for myself.

I guess some of the younger engineers had it worse than me and they were telling me how this guy would tell them in their face about how disqualified they were for the job and that why did they even get hired (which would crush me). 

Like idk if this is normal at all companies, it just felt like the entire time everything has been so disorganized, nobody really knows what‚Äôs going on, but everyone just tries to keep going to get a paycheck.

I feel weird about it also bc I don‚Äôt have anything lined up and even though I‚Äôm waiting to hear back from 2 companies on interviews, I do know that the job market is tough. I just hated the stress of not knowing what was asked of me and being belittled for it, and I was so afraid to make mistakes or talk to anyone that I just sort of knew that I couldn‚Äôt live like that.

I just feel so confused tbh and the director guy was so astonished and said that I could always comeback, my supervisor told me that as well, so idk it all feels very odd. I kind of just wanted more meaningful work bc it was DOD contracter work and it‚Äôs all very system engineering focused which doesn‚Äôt have that much engineering. ","Hello /u/MurkyNeedleworker193!

,," Is not normal, the guy is an asshole and just because others thought it was okay to suck it up doesn‚Äôt mean what he‚Äôs doing is okay. I‚Äôm glad you stood up for yourself, never let anyone treat you like shit in the workplace, no matter their position."
,,"Horribly toxic and abusive work environment, just because other people suffered through it does NOT make it okay. It is not the norm and should not be treated as such.  I'm glad you got out. Do not go back to this company ever, it's too bad you already did your interview because I would have said to take and bring notes, and rail the guy leading this whole shit show, he deserves to be fired."
,,I know a lot of companies blow off the intern until they're about to leave then cram everything down their throat. It's not good practice by any means but definitely happens. The other stuff is definitely not normal
,,Never look back. There will be bigger and better things ü§ôüèª
,,"dude fuck this guy hahahaha ‚Äúbreaking in the interns‚Äù what life do these people think they‚Äôre living

once you spend some time with some composed & competent engineers/decent people you‚Äôll realize all that rah rah act is pure bullshit. Has nothing to do with engineering. 

You‚Äôre not a ‚Äúwimp‚Äù, you‚Äôre just not a dumbass. You did good. Go find somewhere good to work for and put this behind you."
,,"So sounds like you're wrapping up your schooling?  
Regarding the bad experience, do not let that discourage you. Sometimes the wrong people are placed in leadership positions for the wrong reasons. There is a wide range of company cultures, and then the unique folks in the company. 

Personal summarized career path (graduated 2020)

My first internship was fantastic example of what a leadership team(our management) should be. I have been to 5 other companies (internships and full-time jobs) after that.   
  
The next one, the Quality Manger that hired me, resigned the Friday I was to start, (Quality dept. tends to get the short end of the stick), luckily one of the Quality Engineers with a machinist background taught me lots on understanding drawings+.  
  
Next one, covid hit, summer internship 3 month reduced to a 2 month, late start getting our equipment, luckily supervisor and co supervisor and other coworker were awesome guys. Helped me how to build an effective presentation for our intern updates.

First lined up job, commute was 1.5 hrs don't recommend almost died, plant manager didn't know who I was for a couple of weeks, was hired to cover a process area that already had someone that was the guy for the process area (lack of purpose for my role).

Next Job, got lots of experience on CAD, design, etc. however my supervisor kind of shut me down day one and eventually left for it. Was easier to leave.

Job today, lots of flexibility, my boss is the best one I've had probably out all of them. Allows room for development, not micromanage, willing to help if I need anything ( I try to keep it at a minimal), but we happily cover each others backs when needed. We share the same mindset, even though the overall company culture is a bit on the too lenient side for their own good. But we continue to progress on how we think is right.

Conclusion, some places suck, if you don't have a choice and need to be somewhere for a bit to build some skills or something, ask questions, learn what you can and more, be humble. And if you are at the almost end of your schooling, start applying in high quantity but effectively early. Join career fairs especially ones from clubs if you can..

Wish you the best of luck!"
,,This sounds like the average DOD civilian. Does he go around talking about how he was a retired SGM?
