            # The Two-Way ANOVA Test
            ## Welcome to the Post-Apocalyptic ANOVA Bunker Simulator!
            **Greetings, brave survivor!** Don't worry, you're not actually trapped in a bunker surrounded by strange monsters. 
            This is just a fun and slightly unsettling way to explore the fascinating world of Two-Way ANOVA testing.

            Disclaimer: No actual apocalypses were triggered in the making of this application. The monsters outside are purely fictional and are not planning to eat your brain... probably.
            
            Here's what you need to know:

            * You're safe behind your computer screen.
            * The other bunkers can't actually hear your screams.
            * The strange noises you hear are just your neighbor's cat... we hope.

            So sit back, relax, and prepare to dive into the thrilling world of statistical analysis â€“ post-apocalyptic style! 
            Remember, in this simulation, the only thing truly terrifying is a p-value greater than 0.05.
            Now, let's explore how different factors affect survival rates in our imaginary bunker network. Who knows? 
            The skills you learn here might come in handy during the real apocalypse. (Just kidding... or are we?)

             **The Two-Way ANOVA Test!** ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance.

             Using the Two-Way ANOVA Test, we can test two different **factors** and their **levels** to see whether they have an effect
             on a continuous outcome variable, and whether they interact with each other. 
             The **factors** are independent categorical variables, where the *levels* are the types within each category.
             The outcome variable is our dependent variable.

             In our case, we can measure the noise coming from outside, and we can report back over this channel with data over the next three hours. 
             And we can report it with

             1. what noteworthy substance is in your bunker. For example, I have some silver here. That should work against werewolves.
             2. whether your bunker has any religious iconography. Vampires hate that.

             Those are our two factors.

             We just need a few things to be true to perform our test.

             1. We need at least 3 groups to record data independently. We should be good there, because we have several bunkers reporting data.
             2. We need our audio data to be normal distributions.
             3. We need the variance of our audio data to be homegenous. We can check this using Levene's Test.
