# Team Assignment #7
## Feature Engineering

## Instructions
Put together a code demo for a python feature engineering package of your choice. A few examples include: opencv, nltk, and TSfresh, although there are many domain specific ones. 

For your example, use a built-in dataset if possible or a dataset that can be accessed through a python library. If not possible, add sample data to the data/ repository.  

### Code should be:
* Clean and well organized script
* Using best practices (if you aren’t sure, go back to the Premodule content)
* Well-commented
* Contains appropriate unit testing
* Clear name (ie ‘opencv_demo.py’)

## Submission
To submit your code, make a PR into the feature-engineering-ta7 branch and add me and the TA as reviewers. Also, add any requirements (and versions) that are not currently in the requirements.txt file to the text of your PR.

## Rubric
### Code (45 points)
* A python package for feature engineering is demonstrated
* A small dataset for testing purposes is either a built-in dataset, accessible via a python package, or added to the data/ repository
* Code is a script, not a notebook
* Code is clean and well organized
* Code is documented with docstrings and comments 
* Code is free of commented out code (ie debug print statements)
* Script has a clear name
* Branching and PRs were done appropriately
* Requirements are included in the text of the PR and are correct and versioned
* The code runs as documented
