# Team Assignment #1
## Data Sourcing

## Instructions
1. Create a feature branch in the class GitHub repository for your team. 

2. Put together a code demo for your assigned topic. 
Code should be:
* Clean and well organized script
* Using best practices (if you aren’t sure, go back to the Premodule content)
* Well-commented
* Contains appropriate unit testing
* Clear name (ie ‘web-scraping-selenium.py’)

3. Create a <5 minute video documenting your topic and code demo. 

## Submission
To submit your code, make a PR into the data-sourcing-ta1 branch and add me and the TA as reviewers. In your PR, add the link to your demo video. Also, add any requirements (and versions) that are not currently in the requirements.txt file to the text of your PR.

## Topics
* Web scraping with Selenium
* Web scraping with Beautiful Soup
* Web scraping using requests
* Using Hugging Face API for getting datasets
* Use an API from a social platform (i.e. Strava, Twitter)
* Use the PubMed API
* [maybe] Collect sensor data from a Raspberry Pi (temperature sensor may be the easiest, but you can use any sensor)

* Video is well organized and clear
* Video documents topic and code effectively
