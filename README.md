## 1. Installation
1. Go to the venv or conda you want to use.
2. Install the application using `pip install .`
3. The program will be installed with name `pokeapi`
4. To install dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 2. Running Instruction
1. To run the application, run `pokeapi` in terminal
2. Wait for the data to be extracted from the PokeAPI for the first time (This may take a minute.)
3. Once the data is downloaded, the PyQt window will pop up
4. Type in the names of 2 pokemon to be compared
5. Hit 'compare' then 'ok' to continue
6. View the comparison and compare another 2 pokemon if you wish
7. Hit Exit to close the application
8. If `pokeapi` is run a second time, the extraction step will be skipped and the application should launch

# The following is the requirement on github.
## Data Sourcing

## Instructions
1. Create a feature branch in the class GitHub repository for your team. 

2. Put together a code demo for your assigned topic. 
Code should be:
* Clean and well organized script
* Using best practices (if you aren’t sure, go back to the Premodule content)
* Well-commented
* Contains appropriate unit testing
* Clear name (ie ‘web-scraping-selenium.py’)

3. Create a <5 minute video documenting your topic and code demo. 

## Submission
To submit your code, make a PR into the data-sourcing-ta1 branch and add me and the TA as reviewers. In your PR, add the link to your demo video. Also, add any requirements (and versions) that are not currently in the requirements.txt file to the text of your PR.

## Topics
* Web scraping with Selenium
* Web scraping with Beautiful Soup
* Web scraping using requests
* Using Hugging Face API for getting datasets
* Use an API from a social platform (i.e. Strava, Twitter)
* Use the PubMed API
* [maybe] Collect sensor data from a Raspberry Pi (temperature sensor may be the easiest, but you can use any sensor)

## Rubric
### Code (30 points)
* Code is a script, not a notebook
* Code is clean and well organized
* Code is documented with docstrings and comments 
* Code is free of commented out code (ie debug print statements)
* Script has a clear name
* Branching and PRs were done appropriately
* Requirements are included in the text of the PR and are correct and versioned
* The code runs as documented

### Video (15 points)
* < 5 minutes
* The video is of mid-high production quality and doesn’t contain significant background noise 
* Video is well organized and clear
* Video documents topic and code effectively
