# Pre-module Assignment

This is Tejas Jyothi's pre-module assignment. I have read in a dataset and my script outputs the species with greatest average petal length.
My python script is in petal.py with an additional test.py for unit tests. The requirements.txt file remains the same.
I apologize for the test folder, I short-sightedly named my venv test.

## Running The Program

I tried to package the script into a command line tool. From the terminal, cd into the dist file and from there input
```
   petal
   ```
or depending on command line shell
```
   .\petal
   ```
It is also acceptable to run
```
   python petal.py
   ```
however I did not know if this met the requirements of being packaged into a command line tool.
